# Lab Setup

These labs are designed to be run inside a virtual machine (VM) created using Vagrant and KVM/libvirt. This ensures a consistent environment for all users and avoids the need to install dependencies directly on your host system.

## Install KVM Hypervisor

You want to install vagrant and the libvirt provider on a preferably Debian-based Linux host hypervisor system:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y git vagrant vagrant-libvirt \
  libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients virtinst virt-manager \
  qemu-kvm qemu-utils
```

If on other, non-debian package manager, based systems, please refer to the respective package manager documentation and repository information for installing analogs of these packages. And yes you could probably get by using other hypervisors supported by Vagrant such as VirtualBox even on other operating systems, but we strongly recommend using Linux.

## Clone and build the brothaman-z12-box

A one time build of the brothaman/z12 (Debian 12 -- Bookworm with ZFS) vagrant box is required before first use:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/brothaman-org/brothaman-z12-box
cd brothaman-z12-box
./build.sh
```

## Clone and fire up the brothaman lab VM

Now we clone the brothaman repo and fire up the brothaman lab VM:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/brothaman-org/brothaman
cd brothaman
vagrant up && vagrant snapshot save before-starting
```
